## Issues encountered during development
I encountered an authentication error when connecting my Flutter app to Firebase. The app failed to authenticate users despite correct API key configuration.

### Solutions to the issue
   1. **Identifying the Issue**: Checked Firebase console for error logs, which pointed to a misconfigured OAuth client ID.
   2. **Research**: Reviewed Firebase documentation and community forums for similar issues.
   3. **Troubleshooting Steps**: Updated OAuth client ID in Firebase console to match the one in my appâ€™s configuration files.
   4. **Solution**: Successfully authenticated users after ensuring all credentials matched across Firebase and app settings.
